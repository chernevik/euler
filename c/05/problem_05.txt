2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


NOTES

Postulate -- Divisibility: A numerator is evenly divisible by a denominator if the factors of the denominator are a subset of the factors of the numerator.


IF TRUE:
- need a set of the factors of numbers less than or equal to 20
- the lowest evenly divisible number will be some multiple of the primes
-   I think this will do it, actually

-   not sure what other conditions might apply -- if the 


- how to check for lower?
