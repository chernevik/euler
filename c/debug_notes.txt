following http://www.unknownroad.com/rtfm/gdbtut/gdbsegfault.html

compile with -g flag
    << gcc -g factorize.c >>

open in debugger
    gdb a.out

in debugger:
- run code:  << run >>
- observe variables:
    << print [variable name] >>

how to set break points:
    break [file:]function
    - sets break point at function
    
can breaks be set inside functions?
