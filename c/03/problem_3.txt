PROBLEM:

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?


PRIME FACTORIZATION PROCESS 
- Divide target number by prime numbers, greater than 1, in increasing
  sequence, until reaching a prime that divides the target evenly.
    - This prime is a factor of the target
    - The number of times that prime divides into the target, I term 'the
      dividend'
- If the dividend is not itself prime, find the prime factors of the dividend.
  Each of these is a prime factor of the target.
- If the dividend is itself prime, the dividend is a prime factor of the number. 


TO CHECK A NUMBER FOR PRIME
- Check all integers whose square is less than the number for a remainder,
  using the modulus operation.  If any have no remainder, the number is
  divisible by that integer, and is not prime.
- Algorithm taken from King.
- Don't know why integer square less than the number is the right limit --
  figure that out
